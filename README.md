# SimpleChat
This is my first chat program, so there will be errors and all, please ignore them.
It is a simple comman line based chat application, including one server and one client.
Server accepts connection from one client and displays messages passed by client to it and send back a reply.
Client sends messages to server and displayes reply from server.
Client and server closes connection when client sends 'logout' message.
